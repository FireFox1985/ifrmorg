Just breathe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cb\u003eTune into your breath.\u003c/b\u003e Feel the natural flow of breath—in, out. You don’t need to do anything to your breath. Not long, not short, just natural. Notice where you feel your breath in your body. It might be in your abdomen. It may be in your chest or throat or in your nostrils.

You may start thinking about other things. If this happens, it is not a problem. It’s very natural. Just notice that your mind has wandered. You can say “thinking” or “wandering” in your head softly. And then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) \u003cb\u003eStay here for five to seven minutes.\u003c/b\u003e Notice your breath, in silence.
