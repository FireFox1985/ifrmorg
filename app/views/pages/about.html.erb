Mental health is a profound aspect our lives. For most people, it is difficult and often shameful to speak out about mental illness.
Although our loved ones should not be therapists, being open with them is the key to dealing with mental illness in a healthy and productive way. We interact with these people everyday and they shape our self-perception. 

Making <em>if me</em> open-source is important because mental health is such a individual experience. Everyone who deals with it has something unique and insightful to offer when it comes to dealing with it.
