<p>Hi there, my name is <a href="http://julianguyen.org" target="_blank">Julia Nguyen</a> and I have been dealing with obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>Being open and honest about these issues is helping me to confront it. My hope is to encourage others to feel comfortable about talking about their own experiences.</p>

<p>I have been having discussions with friends, family, co-workers, and peers at mental health centres like <a href="http://camh.ca" target="_blank">CAMH</a> about how to involve others in coping with mental illness.</p>

<p>Mental health is a profound aspect our lives. For most people, it is difficult and often shameful to speak out about mental illness.</p>

<p>Although our loved ones should not be therapists, being open with them is the key to dealing with mental illness in a healthy and productive way. We interact with these people everyday and they shape our self-perception.</p>

<p>Making <em>if me</em> open-source is important because mental health is such a individual experience. Everyone who deals with it has something unique and insightful to offer when it comes to dealing with it.</p>
